            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <div id="aboutPara">
                <p>Hello! My name is Julia, and I am a third-year undergraduate student at the 
                    University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Information 
                    (BSI) degree. I am studying at the School of Information with a concentration on 
                    Information Analysis. I am highly interested in the field of data science and am 
                    excitedly pursuing a summer internship to help me strengthen my skills in data analytics.
                </p>
    
                <p>I am a highly analytical individual who loves finding patterns and connecting the dots 
                    within seas of information. I am passionate about using technology and data to gather 
                    insights and develop solutions to today's complex problems. Throughout my studies at the 
                    University of Michigan, I have acquired numerous skills in a range of technologies including 
                    Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and R.

            <div id="handPara">
                <p>I grew up in Madison, Connecticut where I attended Daniel Hand High School.
                    I graduated in June, 2019 with an unweighted GPA of 3.9/4.0.
                    Throughout my time in high school, I was very involved in my community and 
                    spent my afternoons tutoring young students in nearby New Haven, CT. I also
                    co-directed and individually led local blood drives with the American Red Cross, 
                    organizing drives both within DHHS and off campus.

                <p> In September, 2019, I began my studies in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan.
                    Earlier this year, in 2021, I was admitted to the university's upper-level program within
                    the School of Information where I currently study Information Analysis. I expect to 
                    graduate with my Bachelor of Science in 2023. Outside of the classroom, I am involved in 
                    Dance Marathon at UM, and I am a member of our campus's Girls who Code club. I am also a very 
                    involved member with my sorority on campus, Delta Delta Delta.
